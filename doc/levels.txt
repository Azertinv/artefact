Phase tutorial:
    Arithmetic calculator
        What is =,C,0,+,-,*,/,1,T,TT1,T0111,TT01T
    No playground
    Artefact:
        nop
        arithmetic operations
            iadd sub mul div mod add_fz sub_fz
        registers manipulation
            radd sub mul div mod add_fz sub_fz
            set mov

Phase 1:
    Logic calculator
    locked playground:
        only discovered opcodes
    programs:
        logic operations
            shift and or xor not
        memory operations
            load store
    break out of the locked playground by executing arbitrary opcodes, transition to phase 2

Phase 2:
    unlocked playground
    programs:
        condition
            cmp
            cjumpabs cjumprel
        control flow
            callabs callrel
        stack manipulation
            push pop

Phase 3:
    devices and real programs

TODO allocate:
    intret
    setup
    in out
