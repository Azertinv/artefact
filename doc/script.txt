        After years of studies at the Alien Technology Institute I've finally graduated.
        I got lucky and found a job right out of school and today is my first day!
        With this job I'll finally get my hands on a real Alien Construct,
        not a lame emulated one like at the institute.

    Enter office
        TODO:
            mention report earlier

        Finally, here is the building.

        Mmh, why is there nobody at the front desk ?

        I guess I work here now anyway.
        I'll just go and find the Alien Construct Research Lab (ACRL).

        Ah here it is, do I just knock ?

        - ???
        Hey you're the new hire right ?

        - You
        Hi, yes, there wasn't anybody at the front desk so I just walked around to find the lab.

        - ???
        We have a front desk ?

        - Yelena
        Anyway my name's Yelena, welcome to the ACRL!
        I'm the head researcher by default since I'm the only one assigned to this lab.

        - Yelena
        I'm gonna start you on this new artefact the hardware team managed to get to work.
        Unfortunately it's not an Alien Construct BUT it's the first
        silicon based alien tech we ever found! Exciting!

        - You
        Wait isn't silicon really old technology ?
        And I don't even know anything about silicon based computers, I only studied Alien Constructs.

        - Yelena
        Yeeeeah, don't worry about that! I'm sure you'll get the hang of it.
        Anyway, gotta go do something else right now.
        Get to work, I'll check your report when I get back, good luck!
